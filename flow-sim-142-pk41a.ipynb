    "# Summary of Our Testing Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "After extensive testing, the results of which are not presented here, we decided to do quadratic programming calculations using the Python package Pytorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quadratic programming algorithm was originally tested in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commercial Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "We considered using free academic versions of commercial packages like Gurobi or Mosek but found the interface too clunky, too slow, and too hard to learn.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One issue is that our quadratic programming problem has \"easy\" assumptions (diagonal positive definite quadratic matrix and box inequality constraints) but is \"big\" (hundreds of equality constraints and hundreds of thousands or millions of inequality constraints).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gurobi says is does not handle sparse matrices and uses cpus rather than gpus.  Maybe this is just the interface, and we did not figure out how to use it properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Gurobi or other commercial packages is a possiblity for the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cvxopt Package\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cvxopt package uses an interior point algorithm which works well. It has several disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It uses its own sparse and dense matrix algebra language, which has its own commands (with difficult conversions back and forth to numpy/scipy).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It is difficult to edit code to make the algorithm work differently.  Cvxopt does offer the option to supply custom solvers. We used this option to solve the linearized system with a Cholesky decomposition of a matrix whose dimensions are the number of assets.  The Cvxopt default would try to solve an impossible gigantic system with a bigger Cholesky decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It does not perform calculations on a gpu.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It is slower than alternatives. Perhaps the sparse matrix calculations are not parallelized???\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numpy and Scipy\n",
    "\n",
    "A variation on the Cvxopt algorithm was implemented in Numpy and Scipy direclty (using a variation of the algorithm described by Vandenberghe (2011???). This provided more flexibility but had several shortcomings: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Numpy does not seem to parallelize element-by-element operations on vectors, even though they are parallelized on matrix-matrix operations (using mkl). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scipy uses a single core for sparse matrix and vector operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Numpy and Scipy do not use a gpu.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OSQP\n",
    "\n",
    "OSQP is a gradient-based optimization algorithm for quadratic programming. In general first-order methods (gradient) can achieve quick progress early in the optimization process, then slow down as they converge to equilibrium. In contrast, second order methods (based on hessians or linearizing first-oder conditions, such as interior point methods), converge very fast (quadratically) when close to the optimum. \n",
    "\n",
    "We downloaded the OSQP algorithm from the Stellato website and also wrote our own version based on the paper by Stellato et al. In both cases, the algorithm slowed down greatly before getting close to equilibrium prices. Even after thousands of iterations, it was not close to convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our problem, it is necessary to calculate market-clearing prices accurately, even for very poorly conditioned problems (low liquidity limit order books). This rules out OSQP.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, each iteration of the interior point method is surprisingly simple. It requires mostly element-by-element calculations plus a few sparse-matrix--vector products, except for two bigger ones:  a Cholesky decomposition and the construction of the symmetric positive definite matrix to be decomposed. The number of rows and columns of this matrix is equal to the number of assets.  If the number of assets is small enough, Cholesky decomposition seems to be the best approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a very large number of assets, some other way of solving a linear system will be needed, perhaps conjugate gradient method with some variations?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient method\n",
    "\n",
    "We wrote our own bespoke gradient method and also tried various Scipy optimizers using gradient-like methods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "None of these worked efficiently. These methods have two problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gradient methods do not achieve enough accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Gradient methods do not make smart decisions about search directions because they use local rather than global information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second-order methods in Scipy were too hard to implement and would also suffer from Scipy not parallelizing sparse matrix-vector products.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we tried using conjugate gradient method to solve linearized system.  This did not work well because we want our algorithm to deal well with poorly conditioned linear approximations. Conjugate gradient performs poorly in such cases for two reasons: it takes many iterations, and numerical error accumulates over these many iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cupy\n",
    "\n",
    "Cupy does calculations on a gpu.  We found it slower and less flexible than Pytorch (discussed next).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Qpsolvers\n",
    "\n",
    "Qpsolvers is a python package which interfaces between generic quadratic programming problems and various quadratic programming packages, including both free and commercial ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could not get this package to improve our approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pytorch\n",
    "\n",
    "Pytorch is has a language for arrays which mimics Numpy.  It has several advantages: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. It parallelizes element-by-element calculations on vectors, both on the cpu and gpu. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. It uses multiple cpu and gpu cores for other operations, including some sparse ones (???).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It makes it easy to do calculations on a gpu. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The cpu and gpu calculations are fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pytorch has other advantages not relevant for this project. It has automatic differentiation, which is useful in optimization problems requiring complicated gradient and hessian calculations.  It also has a convenient optimization infrastructure, which is useful for neural nets and machine learning.  This optimization framework has algorithms for feeding data to optimizers efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pytorch has disadvantages, which can be overcome: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is more overhead than Numpy for each call to the vectorized array operations. This can be reduced (or even eliminated) by compiling Pytorch code with torchscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sparse matrix-vector products are not implemented on the cpu using Windows (This requires a work-around function described below).\n",
    "\n",
    "After extensive testing, the details of which are not in this notebook, we discovered that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On cpus, pytorch is somewhat faster than cvxopt and numpy/scipy.  Pytorch can be further speeded up by compiling with torchscript, but the speedup is typically 30 percent or less.  The cpu calculations are fastest using two cores. More than two cores slows things down. This is true with numpy and scipy as well.  This presumably results from overhead from using multiple cores combined with the sequential nature of the optimization, which limits parallel calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. On the gpu, Pytorch is about 3-5 times faster than Pytorch on the cpu (relatively faster for bigger problems with more orders).  Pytorch is faster on both element-by-element calculations and sparse matrix-matrix and matrix-vector calculations. The quadratic programming algorithm does not have many dense matrix-matrix calculations, but they are faster on the gpu than on cpu as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does pytorch work so well? Pytorch seems to have its own programming language written in C/C++. This language has optimized algorithms for array calculations. This achieves speed and also overcomes Python's global interpreter lock (GIL), making parallelization easier.  It seems to have good algorithms for the gpu. The gpu algorithms are multiple times faster than cpu algorithms for element-by-element calculations, matrix-vector products, matrix-matrix products.  Its sparse gpu calculations are multiple times faster than sparse cpu calculations (contrary to conventional wisdom???). \n",
    "\n",
    "It can compile code on-the-fly with torchscript. This presumably gives C/C++ speeds to algorithms.  With torchscript, pytorch also seems to optimize code on-the-fly by analyzing it as it executes, then recompiling in a manner that speeds up calculations when it detects, for example, that array sizes are constant.  This can backfire in tests which change the size of arrays every few iterations but otherwise generally works well.  It does, however, require running tests three or more times to see maximum benefits. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is the overall computer science strategy behind Pytorch?  We are not sure but here is what we think based on experience and reading online discussions: Two big trends are (1) lazy evaluation based on saving computation graphs, (2) automatic differentiation, (3) parallel calculations, and (4) graphics cards. In general, there is a tradeoff between compiling things in advance and waiting as late as possible into runtime to compile things.  There is also a tradeoff between compiling templates, which can become complicated, and keeping the number of types small by not using many templates. Pytorch takes the approach of having a small number of types (not using templates) and compiling as late as possible while things are running. Having a small number of types might be making it possible to optimize each type better. Indeed, torchscript sometimes seems to wait until a function has run a couple of times, then recompiles it on the fly based on how it is actually used rather than how it might theoretically be used. This allows dynamic optimizations which would not be possible otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Torchscript is a limited language,  with significant constraints on the kinds of code which it can deal with. This explains why the quadratic programming algorithm below is broken into some otherwise nonintuitive steps. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It also does not allow very convenient printing (presumably because its main uses case does not involve debugging).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. It likes to type things in a manner understandable by C/C++. Thus, it like dictionaries of objects which are the same type.  This requires workarounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It does not deal with classes very well if the classes define their own functions. In the quadratic programming algorithm below, there is extensive use of functions where classes would otherwise naturally be used.  For example, it would be natural to define linear operators as classes, but this does not seem to work in pytorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It handles torch.tensor types but not numpy and scipy types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quadratic programming algorithm below requires Pytorch but offers several options, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Switching between cpu and gpu to compare performance and numerical results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Turning torchscript (torch.jit.script) on or off. Nevertheless, even when torchscript is not used, the code is essentially the same, conforming to torchscript's simplistic requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Switching between float32 and float64. We find that float32 is not accurate enough and sometimes gets stuck due to rounding error. But it is twice as fast as float64.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, there are two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulating an order book:  This is done in numpy since the first version was in numpy, but it could be done more quickly in pytorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Quadratic program to calculate market clearing prices and quantities:  This is done in Pytorch due to computation efficiency, especially using the gpu. \n",
    "\n",
    "Switching from the numpy order book to the pytorch optimization requires an interface to convert objects from one type to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on QP inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Quadratic programming algorithms often use a standard form which stacks inequality constraints on top of each other.  Instead of using this approach, our current approach treats the less-than constraints separately from the greater-than constraints, mimicking the mu and lambda notation in the paper rather than the standard quadratic programming approach with stacked constraints, called say z.  We have tried the standard approach as well.  Our approach is perhaps slightly slower since it involves twice as many Python function calls to do unstacked operations. We use it because it is easier to map the approach to the paper."

    "## TODO List\n",
    "\n",
    "For further experimentation, these are possible directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up specific matrix-multiplication functions similar to the function for generating the AQA matrix. This would make the algorithm cleaner and easier to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add a larger number of user-defined portfolios to the order book. This would increase the number of registered portfolios by an enormous amount.  Mina suggests generating random portolios with a random number of assets in the portfolios. This allows measuring the sensitivity of the algorithm's execution time to the number of registered portfolios. If the portfolios are truly random, PK thinks there may be plenty of liquidity for almost all assets.  This might make a conjugate gradient method more efficient for solving the underlying linear system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Put the individual-asset orders and pairs-trade orders into separate arrays.  The current approach stacks them into one array but needs to sort by number of portfolios and needs to carry around an extra parameter to remember the boundary between the sorted groups.  We might have separate sparse arrays for orders with 1, 2, 3,...,k portfolios, then put any orders with a larger number of assets into a separate category.  We need to figure out two numerical boundaries: When is it efficient to use the bespoke method for generating AQA, then after that when to shift from sparse to dense calculations.  For example, we might use a bespoke method for 1, 2, or 3-portfolio orders, use sparse arrays for 4, 5,...,25-portfolios, and dense arrays for 26+ portfolios per order.  This example would involve 5 arrays: 1-portfolio orders (like now), 2-portfolio orders (like now), 3-portfolio orders (need to add), 4-25 portfolio orders (sparse arrays), 25+ portfolio orders (dense arrays).  One advantage of separate arrays for these different portfolios is that the gpu may perform calculations at the same time since calculations are asynchronous. This, of course, assumes that the gpu is not totally occupied already.  The small P1000 gpu on PK's laptop has far fewer cores than newer gpus, so newer gpus may be much faster doing these calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Develop a strategy for dealing with many assets, say N > 2000.  This would be relevant for corporate bond markets or for markets for all ticker symbols or all stock options simultaneously.  Presumably, Cholesky decomposition, which is an $N^3$ algorithm, will not work well because it offers limited opportunities for parallelization.  Another possibility might be conjugate gradient, but it will have to deal with poorly conditioned problems associated with very low liquidity for very illiquid assets.  Perhaps preconditioning with a Cholesky decomposition or approximation to a Cholesky decomposition might work. We deal with poor conditioning by adding a small amount of exchange trading to make linear approximations better conditioned. Inside the algorithm, another approach used is to add small quantities to the diagonal of the positive defininte matrix to be decomposed.  This makes it more positive definite, so that the Cholesky decomposition does not fail. We need to investigate more carefully whether some kind of dynamic adjustment to exchange inventories and adding elements to the diagonal can improve the performance of the algorithm.  If Cholesky decomposition is not used, the same approach could be used in the context of, say, the conjugate gradient method.  This is related to the problem of handling the rare cases when the algorithm gets stuck. This seems to be related to poor conditioning of the \"liquidity matrix\" in the linear system which needs to be solved.  In general, it can be \"fixed\" by adding more exchange trading. Adding more to the diagonal may or may not work since the resulting search direction may not be good enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Figure out a good way to warm-start an interior point method.  This seems to be a difficult or even impossible problem, based on cursory look at literature on google scholar.  In this notebook, we do have an algorithm which starts iterations using float32 (for speed), then warm-starts when switching to float64 for the final iterations (for accuracy). This sometimes does not work well, perhaps due to rounding error making the float32 approximate solution, used as a warm start the float64 calculations, too far from the central path needed for the float64 calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Try free versions of commercial solvers such as Gurobi or Mosek.  The key issues seem to be overcoming a slow interface (which checks the form of the problum), using sparse arrays, and using gpus."

    "# Methodology for Simulating an OrderBook\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of the order book as consisting of three types of orders: (1) orders for individual assets, (2) orders for indexes, and (3) orders for pairs trades to buy one asset or index and sell a different asset or index. If the number of indexes is defined broadly enough, this could cover orders for arbitrary portfolios.  In our simulations, there are equally weighted and value weighted indexes for the market as a whole, for size quantiles (defined by expected dollar volume), and for industry quintiles defined by assets defined by having the same dollar volume rank modulo the number of industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the base case Assumptions, we have $N = 500$ assets, $M = 100000$ orders, $num\\_size\\_indexes = 5$ size quantiles, and $num\\_industry\\_indexes = 10$ industry quantiles. This implies $(1 + 5 + 10) * 2 = 32$ index portfolios. While this is a small number of indexes compared to the theoretical number of $2^N$ different value-weighted and equally-weighted indexes, it gives a flavor for how index orders affect the way in which prices are determined. Keeping the number of indexes small also makes the algorithm for calculating prices faster, as discussed further below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Assumptions clas defines constants which determine the expected number and dollar size of orders for individual assets, indexes, and pairs trades. The actual number and size of orders is the result of simulations. Thus, the actual number of orders for an individual asset is the realization of a randome variabl whose mean and variance is defined in by assumptions but whose realization is random, typically approximating a Poisson process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our general approach is to make assumptions about the number of orders, then use scaling assumptions to determin the relative expected dollar size of orders, with the actual dollar size determined by a scaling assumptions relating the number of orders to the size of orders. An additional scaling assumption defines expected total dollar order volume across all individual assets (excluding indexes and pairs trades).\n",
    "\n",
    "The scaling relationship between the number and size of orders for individual assets and indexes is obtained by applying the market microstructure invariance hypothesis of Kyle and Obizhaeva (2016). Its main implication is that as dollar volume varies, the dollar size of orders varies with the $1/3$ power of the ratio of dollar volume to return variance, and the number of orders varies with the $2/3$ power of this ratio. Thus, increasing dollar volume by a factor of 8 while holding volatility constant implies that the number of orders increases by a factor of 4 and the size of orders increases by a factor of 2. This hypothesis simplifies the number of assumptions needed, since assumptions about the number of orders imply the expected size of orders, and vice versa.  It is also makes the simulation assumtions more realistic. For example, it is known that orders for thinly traded stocks are much smaller than orders for liquid stocks, and order for large liquid indexes like the market as a whole are very large indeed, approximating conformity with the invariance hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The value-weighted market index is assumed to have many orders, consistent with actual markets. The invariance hypothesis implies---realistically---that individual orders for the value-weighted market index have large dollar size. This implies that the overall value of the market index is heavily dependent on value-weighted market index orders.  In the current market design, the demand for indexes like the CME' S\\&P 500 E-mini futures contract or actively traded ETFs like SPDR influence the prices of individual assets via index arbitrage trading. In our design, the index arbitrage is not necessary because the indexes are defined as the baskets of stocks themselves. Thus, in our design, when a trader buys the value-weighted market index, they do not obtain shares in an ETF-like asset but instead obtain different numbers of shares in $N=500$ different assets."

    "### Orders for Individual Stocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the total number of assets is $N = 500$, the total number of orders is $M = 100000$, and the fraction of total orders for individual assets is $frac_MA = 0.50$. Then the total number of orders for all individual assets is the nonstochastic quantity $MA := M * frac_MA = 100000 * 0.50 = 50000$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The expected number of orders for each asset is obtained by assuming that the expected number of orders for an asset has a lognormal distribution with (log)variance $std\\_num\\_orders\\_asset = 1.7$. For each asset, an expected number of orders is generating by first drawing from this lognormal distribution for each stock, summing the 500 random lognormally distributed quantities, then dividing each draw from the lognormal by their sum to obtain for each asset the fraction of total orders expected for that asset. The mean of the lognormal distribution does not matter because the results add up to one after dividing by their sum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, for each of the $MA = 50000$ individual asset orders, a random variable is drawn from a multinomial distribution whose probability weights are the expected fraction of orders for each asset. The integer drawn from the multinomial distribution determines the asset to which the order applies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since 1.7 is a large standard deviation, it is likely there are some assets with thousands of orders and some assets with no orders at all.  This is intentional. Our market clearing algorithm should be able to find market clearing prices and quantities for each asset, even when there are no individual asset orders for some assets.  Of course, every asset will be part of orders for a value-weighted or equally-weighted market portfolio. The prices of illiquid assets are therefore likely to be heavily influenced by orders for indexes.\n",

The algorithm is implemented in numpy and scipy using an interior point method which follows the methodology in the *cvxopt* documentation but does not actually use the *cvxopt* package.  It should take a similar number of iterations as the cvxopt algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is specialized to our problem, where the matrix $D$ ($Q$ in the algorithm) is diagonal positive definite. It can therefore be efficiently represented as a diagonal sparse matrix.  The algorithm uses registered portfolios to speed up execution. Each order trades one or two registered portfolios. Registered portfolio can be either single assets or indexes. Orders are specified by matrix $W$. The matrix $R$ is the portfolio weights defining registered portfolios. If formed explicitly, the matrix $R$ concatenates an identity matrix defining trivial weights for individual assets with another matrix $RX$ defining asset weights for indexes. Instead of forming the matrix $A = R @ W$ to first convert registered portfolio to asset weights, it is more efficient not to calculate $A$ explicitly but instead to multiply by $R$ and $W$ separately because both $R$ and $W$ are very sparse.  Moreover, it is not efficient to form the matrix $R$ explicitly because its embedded identity matrix is handles more efficiently by a linear operator which avoids explicitly multiplying by a diagonal matrix of ones.\n",

The cvxopt algorithm (with my choice of Cholesky method of solving the KKT equations) takes about 0.67 + 0.22 sec, two or three times as long. I think David M.'s workstation should be twice as fast or more.\n",

We do not use the *cvxopt* package itself here but instead use our own direct implementation of the algorithms described in the note. Our implemention uses  *scipy* and *numpy* arrays. The *cvxopt* package uses a different package for matrix algebra; the different package has its own different implementation language. Using the same mathematical notation as Vandenberge's note makes comparing our implementation with the note easier. (One deviation from Vandengerge's notation is that we use $n$ for number of assets and $m$ for number of orders and $2m$ for number of constraints, while Vandenberge uses $n$ for number of orders and $p$ for number of assets.)\n",

The $n+k$ registered portfolio weights consistent of $n$ single asset portfolios defined by unit vectors in $I_n$ plus $k$ sets of portfolio weights defined by the $n \\times k$ matrix R_x. Orders are allowed to trade either one portfolio (single asset or single index) or two portfolio (pairs trade). Thus, in the matrix $W_s$, each column of $W_s$ has either one nonzero element (which implies trading one asset or index) or two non-zero elements (defining a pairs trade, which in the simulations have one positive weight and one negative weight).  Note that $W_s$ in this notebook is different from $W$ in the paper. The subscript $s$ in $W_s$ means \"sparse\", not the dimension of the matrix.  The subscript $x$ in $R_x$ refers to indexes, not the dimension of $R_x$ which is $n \\times k$, meaning one set of $n$ asset weights for each of $k$ portfolios.  In principle, the python representation of $R_x$ could be either a *numpy* dense matrix or a *scipy* sparse matrix.  We use the *scipy* sparse implementation becaus it is slightly faster due to the fact that most indexes have a substantial number of assets and therefore many nonzero weights.\n",
